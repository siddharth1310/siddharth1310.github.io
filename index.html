						1) I'm a problem-solver at heart, always looking for ways to make
						technology more efficient, scalable, and user-friendly. With
						experience in software development, analytics, and infrastructure
						monitoring, I thrive on building solutions that drive real
						impact.<br />
						2) Right now, I'm working on the Patent Analytics Tool (PAT),
						where I develop and enhance features using Python, Django, Machine
						Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Angular. My work involves fixing
						bugs, improving performance, managing deployments, and ensuring
						security through IP Safe Assessments and compliance reviews. I
						also create user guides and architecture documents to make things
						easier for our users.<br />
						3) Before this, I worked in IT infrastructure monitoring and data
						analytics, where I tackled the challenge of analyzing 65,000+
						alerts per month for a major retail client. I built a Power BI
						dashboard that streamlined the process, cutting down analysis time
						from 8-9 hours to just 15 minutes. I also developed a store
						operations dashboard for Starbucks, providing insights into
						performance trends, alert patterns, and future expansion
						opportunities.<br />
